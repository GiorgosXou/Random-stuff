1. [First make sure you have installed NVIM by running `winget install Neovim.Neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#winget)
2. Install Nerdfonts
3. Run `nvim` on your terminal, execute the command `:echo stdpath('config')` *(to get `NVIM`'s configuration path & then exit)*
4. if there's no `nvim` folder inside the ^`.config` path, create one
5. [Clone the repository](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim#clone-the-repository) to that exact path.
6. *(Optional)* [create a user profile under that path](https://astronvim.github.io/configuration/manage_user_config)
7. *(Optional)* [I suggest you to install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
8. and you are done.


*Very briefly and not that well (but nvm for now) documented\explained*
